There are times where anonymity is not a priority and the aim is to keep the conversation private.In this instance using email but adding an additional layer of security may be appropriate.Encrypting the contents of an email using public key cryptographic methods is the way to avoid compromise in this instance.</p><br>
<p>You are probably aware that The Guardian uses a third party cloud email solution. Encryption is a good way of gaining confidence that a third party cannot access the contents of the conversation</p><br>
<p>This page contains public keys of Guardian staff should you wish to send an encrypted email to one of them.</p>

<p>There are many different implementations of Public Key Cryptography. At The Guardian we have opted for an open source implementation of the OpenPGP standard.As with any Public Key cryptography implementation there may be client and key incompatabilities - we will do our best to resolve discrepancies but some issues maybe beyond the capabilities of our technological implementation. The Guardian does not endorse any particular PGP integration or client</p>
